# 🛡️ Red Team Journey

Welcome to my personal journey into the world of **Red Teaming**, **Reverse Engineering**, **Binary Exploitation**, and **Low-Level Programming**.

This repository is a structured collection of practice challenges, notes, and code snippets as I explore and master various topics essential for Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and offensive security.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen understanding of system internals, assembly, and memory layouts.
- Develop practical skills in binary exploitation and custom payload crafting.
- Solve and document challenges from platforms like pwn.college, PicoCTF, HTB, etc.
- Build a solid foundation for Red Team operations and OSCP-like certifications.
