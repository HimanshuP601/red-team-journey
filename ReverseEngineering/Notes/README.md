# 📝 Reverse Engineering Notes

This folder contains my personal notes and learnings while diving into the world of reverse engineering. These are not just theoretical — they are based on the actual tools and exercises I work with.

Although I’m still a beginner, I believe in learning by doing — and these notes are a reflection of that journey. I’ve documented everything I found useful, confusing, or insightful, so I can revisit and build on it later.

## 📂 Structure

- `xdbg/`: Notes related to using the x64dbg debugger — interface, setting breakpoints, stack view, tracing functions, and analyzing simple binaries.
- More folders will be added as I explore tools like Ghidra, IDA Free, etc.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

These notes are being updated actively as I continue learning. Some files may be rough or incomplete, but they represent real progress — not just polished theory.
