# xdbg Assembly Executables

This folder contains some executable files (`.exe`) that I created using assembly language with the help of x64dbg (xdbg).

Feel free to explore these executables and try creating your own!

## Getting Started

1. Open `template1.exe` in x64dbg.
2. Use it as a base to learn and experiment with assembly.
3. Modify and create your own executables by following similar steps.

Happy reverse engineering and assembly coding!
