# 🔍 Reverse Engineering Journey

I’ve always wanted to start this repository from scratch to track my learning in reverse engineering — but the sheer scope of this field kept pulling me in multiple directions. Every time I learned something, a new topic or tool would emerge, and I’d get excited about that too. That constant discovery slowed me down in documenting things here… until now.

This repo contains my **notes, practical exercises, and crackme walkthroughs** as I explore reverse engineering — from basic assembly understanding to real-world binary analysis.

### 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast working toward becoming a **Red Team Operator**. I’m especially interested in reverse engineering, exploit development, and offensive security tooling. Though I’m a beginner in this space, I’m consistently pushing myself to go deeper and build a solid foundation.

### 📘 What's Inside
- Assembly language basics (x86/x64)
- Reverse engineering tools and techniques (x64dbg, Ghidra, etc.)
- Crackme walkthroughs and patching exercises
- Notes on calling conventions, stack behavior, control flow, and more

### 📌 Why This Repo?
To **track my progress** in public, stay consistent, and build a portfolio that reflects my learning journey. I believe that documenting and sharing, even as a beginner, helps both me and others grow.
